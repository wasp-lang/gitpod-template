_**🔴 TODO: When you create a new framework template, please:**_
* process all TODO comments and afterwards delete them from this file
* adjust all other values of the new template repo to match what is configured here, e.g. "About", topics, mark it as a GitHub template, set the URL to www.gitpod.io.
* match what you see in [other templates](https://github.com/gitpod-io/?q=template-) if in doubt
